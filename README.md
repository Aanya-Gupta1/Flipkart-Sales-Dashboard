## 🎯 Strategic Outcomes
- Puts the power back in your hands: The dashboard clearly highlights customer buying patterns and preferred payment methods, allowing your teams to make smarter, data-driven decisions instead of just      guessing.
- Focuses the effort: It tells you exactly which product categories (like Electronics) are driving the most revenue, so you know where to prioritize inventory and marketing spend.
- Optimizes the wallet: By showing the impact of the average discount, the dashboard helps you fine-tune your pricing strategy to maximize sales without giving away too much profit.
